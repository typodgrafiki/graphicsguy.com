                        <p>Geo Somatic is a sans serif typeface using a one-letter letter. The inspiration for the font was the geometry of the human circulatory system, i.e. a combination of various geometries with lines of equal thickness. Thanks to this, the typeface has its characteristic elements. The font consists of a minus, and the form allows installation in the operating system or use on a website.</p>

The assumption of the project was to create a common visual identity system by designing a logo with the book of signs, building the concept of packaging and promotional elements. Identification aims to present a product that distinguishes itself on the market by its approach to wine and its individual values. The hidden message is selling wine not as a drink but as values and emotions that it can evoke.</p>
